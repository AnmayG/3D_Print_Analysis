Currently, my plan is to take the data and read it in as a csv file. I can then look at the data and generate a graph for each occurence, eventually generating a final graph based on parameters.
This can be done by using the SQL predict function, where I read the csv file into a database and work from there.
I can then do the SQL code so that it predicts the thing automatically based on input instructions.
This will likely require me to do a model but I don't care.
